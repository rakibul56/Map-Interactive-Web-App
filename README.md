# Map-Interactive-Web-App
EduinfoFinder uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and other technologies like Tailwind CSS for styling and Leaflet.js for interactive maps. The web app allows users to register, login, and maintain their profiles while also providing detailed geospatial information about educational facilities.
